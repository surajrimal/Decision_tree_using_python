# Machine_learning: Decision Tree
Problem statement:

Build decision tree classifiers as given in the tables below. Evaluate their prediction and validation as required.

Dataset

The Cars Evaluation data set consists of 7 attributes, 6 as feature attributes and 1 as the target attribute (car_evaluation). All the attributes are categorical. 
1	buying	vhigh, high, med, low
2	maintenance	vhigh, high, med,low
3	doors	2, 3, 4, 5 , more
4	persons	2, 4, more
5	lug_boot	small, med, big
6	safety	low, med, high
7	car_evaluation 	 unacc, acc, good, vgood

Question 1 For the given data set build a decision tree and evaluate classifier performance

Question 2 Build different decision tree models and evaluate performance using k-fold validation
